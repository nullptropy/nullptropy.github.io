hey! welcome to my little corner of the web where I plan to mostly ramble about anything compsci.

while I'm by no means an expert, I really enjoy tinkering with operating systems, compilers, computer graphics, network applications, and similar topics.

I'm based in Berlin - feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about any of these subjects!
